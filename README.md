<h1> How to use It </h1>
  
First to use this topics as it should be, you have to install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). This is a software where u can take   notes or write ur subjects. You can select what O.S. you're using

We extract de file "My Brain" and save it where you prefer. I put it on my desk to be more accessible <br>

Once you have done this we can go back to Obsidian we have to select the option "Open Vault"

We select the file "My brain" that we download from the repo and now we have access to the topics of Azure learn, but to see it on a better way we are gonna select Graph View and can select the file we want to read just like this
